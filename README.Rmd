`tfserve` provides a [GoogleML](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/prediction-overview)
compatiable REST API for predictions to serve TensorFlow Models from R with ease.

## Quick Start

For example, we can train MNIST as described by [MNIST For ML Beginners](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tensorflow/articles/tutorial_mnist_beginners.html)
and then save using `SavedModelBuilder` and the right signature or, for conviniece, 
use a `tfserve` helper function as follows:

```{r message=F, warning=F}
library(tfserve)

model_path <- "trained/tensorflow-mnist/1"
mnist_train_save(model_path)
```

Then, we can serve this model with ease by running:

```{r eval=F}
serve(model_path)
```
